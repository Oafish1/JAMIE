This data comes from [scGLUE](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01284-4) and each dataset after preprocessing can be found [here](https://scglue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data.html).

The embeddings were generated according to [the scGLUE docs](https://scglue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html) and all hyperparameters aside from latent dimension were left as default.
